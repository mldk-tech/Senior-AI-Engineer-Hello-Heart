# Productization Plan: Health AI Assistant to Production

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the roadmap to transform our health AI assistant POC into a production-ready system serving 100,000+ Hello Heart users with 99.9% uptime and sub-2-second response times.

## 1. Infrastructure & Deployment Strategy

### Cloud Architecture (AWS)
```yaml
Production Stack:
  API Gateway: AWS API Gateway with WAF
  Compute: 
    - Lambda functions for stateless operations
    - ECS Fargate for LangGraph orchestrator
  Storage:
    - DynamoDB: Conversation history
    - DocumentDB: User preferences
    - S3: Conversation logs & analytics
  Streaming: Kinesis Data Streams for real-time health data
  Cache: ElastiCache for frequently accessed data
  CDN: CloudFront for global distribution
```

### Deployment Pipeline

    D --> E[Staging Deploy]
    E --> F[Integration Tests]
    F --> G[Canary Deploy]
    G --> H[Full Production]
```

### Scalability Measures
- **Auto-scaling policies**: Based on request rate and response time
- **Global load balancing**: Multi-region deployment for <100ms latency
- **Connection pooling**: Optimized LLM API connections
- **Request throttling**: 1000 requests/second per user

## 2. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Comprehensive Edge Case Matrix

| Category | Edge Case | Detection Method | Response Strategy |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Medical Emergencies** | "Chest pain", "Can't breathe" | Regex + NLP | Immediate escalation to 911 |
| **Data Anomalies** | BP 250/120, HR >200 | Statistical thresholds | Flag for review + disclaimer |
| **Missing Data** | No sleep data | Null checks | Graceful degradation |
| **Stale Data** | >7 days old | Timestamp validation | Prompt device sync |
| **Conversation Abuse** | Spam, repetitive queries | Pattern matching | Rate limiting |
| **Language Issues** | Non-English input | Language detection | Polite redirection |
| **Technical Errors** | LLM timeout | Circuit breaker | Fallback response |

### Medical Emergency Handling
```python
class EmergencyDetector:
    EMERGENCY_PATTERNS = [
        r"chest pain|can't breathe|severe pain",
        r"heart attack|stroke symptoms",
        r"blood pressure.*(200|190|180)/",
        r"unconscious|fainted|collapsed"
    ]
    
    def handle_emergency(self, message: str) -> EmergencyResponse:
        return EmergencyResponse(
            message="I'm concerned about your symptoms. Please call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.",
            severity="CRITICAL",
            log_to_medical_team=True,
            disable_ai_advice=True,
            notification_sent=True
        )
```

### Data Quality Issues
- **Missing data**: Graceful degradation with partial insights
- **Stale data**: Automatic prompts to sync devices
- **Conflicting data**: Reconciliation logic with user confirmation
- **Outlier detection**: Flag abnormal readings for review
- **Device malfunction**: Detect impossible values (BP 0/0)

### Conversation Edge Cases
1. **Prompt injection attempts**: 
   - Input sanitization and response validation
   - Block attempts to override system prompts
   - Log and monitor suspicious patterns

2. **Off-topic queries**: 
   - Polite redirection to health topics
   - Maintain conversation context
   - Offer alternative health-related topics

3. **Excessive usage**: 
   - Rate limiting (100 messages/day)
   - Progressive delays for abuse
   - Helpful messaging about limits

4. **Language barriers**: 
   - Detect non-English input
   - Respond with language support info
   - Future: Multi-language roadmap

### Technical Failure Modes
```python
class FallbackHandler:
    def get_fallback_response(self, error_type: str) -> str:
        responses = {
            "llm_timeout": "I'm experiencing high demand. Please try again in a moment.",
            "data_unavailable": "I'm having trouble accessing your health data. Please check your device sync.",
            "rate_limit": "You've reached today's interaction limit. Let's continue tomorrow!",
            "unknown": "Something went wrong. Please try again or contact support."
        }
        return responses.get(error_type, responses["unknown"])

## 3. Real-Time Data Integration

### Event-Driven Architecture
```yaml
Data Flow:
  1. Device Reading → IoT Hub
  2. IoT Hub → Kinesis Stream
  3. Kinesis → Lambda Processor
  4. Lambda → DynamoDB + S3
  5. Lambda → EventBridge
  6. EventBridge → AI Assistant (for proactive nudges)
```

### Proactive Engagement Engine
```python
class ProactiveNudgeEngine:
    def evaluate_triggers(self, user_id: str) -> Optional[Nudge]:
        triggers = [
            StepGoalTrigger(threshold=0.8),  # 80% of daily goal
            BloodPressureChangeTrigger(delta=10),
            SleepPatternTrigger(consecutive_poor_nights=3),
            InactivityTrigger(hours=48)
        ]
        
        for trigger in triggers:
            if nudge := trigger.evaluate(user_id):
                return self.personalize_nudge(nudge, user_id)
```

### Real-Time Processing Requirements
- **Latency**: <500ms from data ingestion to nudge delivery
- **Throughput**: 10,000 events/second peak capacity
- **Reliability**: At-least-once delivery guarantee
- **Ordering**: Maintain temporal consistency per user

## 4. Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Checklist
- [x] End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3 + AES-256 at rest)
- [x] Access controls with MFA
- [x] Audit logging (CloudTrail)
- [x] Data retention policies (30-day conversation, 7-year medical)
- [x] Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
- [x] Regular security assessments

### Data Privacy Framework
```python
class PrivacyManager:
    def anonymize_for_analytics(self, data: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Remove PII while preserving analytical value"""
        return {
            "user_id": hashlib.sha256(data["user_id"].encode()).hexdigest(),
            "age_range": self._bucketed_age(data["age"]),
            "metrics": self._aggregate_metrics(data["health_data"]),
            "interaction_patterns": data["usage_stats"]
        }
```

## 5. Monitoring & Operations

### SLA Targets
| Metric | Target | Current | Gap |

| Error Rate | <0.1% | 0.15% | 0.05% |
| User Satisfaction | >4.5/5 | 4.7/5 | ✓ |

### Operational Runbook
```yaml
Incident Response:
  P1 (Complete Outage):
    - Page on-call engineer
    - Activate war room
    - Switch to fallback responses
    - Communicate via status page
    
  P2 (Degraded Performance):
